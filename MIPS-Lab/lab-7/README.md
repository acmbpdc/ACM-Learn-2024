Write MALP for the following:
1. A main procedure calls procedures named sum, difference, product and quotient. 
    All procedures (except main) take two numbers (x,y) as input arguments and return the
    sum (x+y), difference (x-y), product (x*y), quotient (x/y) values to the main procedure.
    The result of each operation is dislayed to the user.

2. Linear search using procedure.
    Input arguments to the procedure: Address of the array, total no. of elements and search element
    Return value(s): 0 (element not found)
                     1 (element found), index

3. Fibonacci series using procedures
    fib(0) = 0
    fib(1) = 1
    fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

    void fibo(int n)
    {
        
    }
